# AIU Schedule

## Introduction
AIU Schedule is a web application for managing class schedules in educational institutions. The application allows users to add, edit, and delete lessons, as well as manage user roles (administrator, teacher, student). The application is developed using modern technologies, ensuring high performance and ease of use.

## Technologies

- **Zustand**: A lightweight library for managing application state, allowing easy management of global state.
- **@dnd-kit/core**: A library for implementing drag-and-drop functionality, enabling users to conveniently move lessons in the schedule.

## Functionality
- **Adding new lessons**: Users can add new lessons by specifying the title, color, teacher, and classroom.
- **Editing existing lessons**: Lessons can be edited by changing their parameters, such as title, teacher, and duration.
- **Dragging lessons**: Lessons can be dragged between schedule cells, making it easy to change class times.
- **Managing user roles**: Administrators can manage user roles, granting or restricting access to certain application features.
- **Visual notifications**: The application displays notifications about duplicate lessons and other important events.
